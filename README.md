## 🔍 Overview

This work proposes **TOT-AWPE**, a **third-order tensor decomposition based adaptive WPE algorithm**, which:

- Decomposes the global multichannel prediction filter using a **third-order Kronecker product structure**
- Replaces the estimation of one long filter with **multiple short, low-rank filters**
- Achieves **significant computational complexity reduction**
- Maintains **comparable or superior dereverberation performance** compared to AWPE and KAWPE
